## Installation of the theme

Open your terminal (`Ctrl+Alt+T`), and copy-Paste the following line:

```
gconftool-2 --load diditheme.xml
```

## To complete the experience

I suggest to install `oh-my-zsh` and use `Flatabulous` ubuntu theme to improve your visual experience.

### Install oh-my-zsh

To install it, you can follow the instruction here: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh, or simply enter the following commands in your terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install git zsh
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

It should be effective after you restart your ubuntu session.

### Use Flatabulous ubuntu theme

Personnaly, I also installed the ubuntu flat theme: `Flatabulous` available here: https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous.

I gives a really fresh design to your ubuntu ;)
